<h2>Difficulties to understand and express oneself</h2>
  
  <p>It’s hard to express oneself, understand what others are saying, finding words or form sentences. Words might be used incorrectly or not make any sense in a certain context.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Try to convey a feeling of safety and calm. Help them understand as much as possible what’s going on.</p>

<p>A light touch, like putting your hand on the person’s shoulder or offering holding your arm, can sometimes have a smoothing effect.</p> 

<p>Try to distract a person who seems to be stuck in a thought or a situation by trying to get her to think about something else.</p>
    
<p>Confirm and play along if you think it feels right. The important thing is to reach the person so that she can get the correct assistance.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
  <p>Because of the dementia the person has problems expressing herself and understanding spoken language.</p>
