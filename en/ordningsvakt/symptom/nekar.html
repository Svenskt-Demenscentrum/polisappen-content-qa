  <h2>Says no</h2>

  <p>The person with dementia says no to every suggestion you make. He doesn’t agree to things even though it’s obvious that it would be the best for him.</p>
    
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  <ul>

<li>Give instructions and information in a positive way.</li>

<li>Be friendly an calm.</li>

<li>Speak slowly in a confident way.</li>

<li>Use a low voice.</li>

<li>Step back and respect the person’s personal space.</li>
    
<li>Make several pauses.</li>
    
<li>Use short sentences and give simple explanations.</li>
    
<li>Ask one thing at a time and allow the person time to reply and collect his thoughts.</li>

</ul>

  <p><strong>Why is the person acting this way:</strong></p>
<p>Because of the dementia it’s hard to follow conversations and to understand abstract topics. It’s hard to understand yes- and noquestions. When you don’t quite understand it’s easier to say no than yes.</p>

<p>Also people with dementia have the right to say no. However, it’s important to realise that it’s our responsibility to make it easier for the person with dementia to choose to say yes.</p>
