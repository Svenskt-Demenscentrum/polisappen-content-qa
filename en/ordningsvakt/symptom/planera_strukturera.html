<h2>Planning and structurizing</h2>

<p>The person cannot take in more than one instruction.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
<p>Think about the following:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Think about your body language.</li>
<li>Never show that you are stressed.</li>
<li>Give information and instructions in a positive way.</li>
<li>Speak slowly in a confident and calm way.</li>
<li>Speak in a low voice.</li>
<li>Make several pauses.</li>
<li>Use short sentences and give simple explanations.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t ask the person to make a choice between different options.</li>
<li>Ask one question at a time and allow for time to reply. She might need time to sort out her thoughts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>

<p>For a person with dementia it becomes increasingly difficult to think, plan, and carry out activities. It also gets increasingly difficult to understand and do more than one thing in an activity.</p>
