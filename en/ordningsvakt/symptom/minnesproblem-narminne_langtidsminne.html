  <h2>Memory problems – short-term and long-term memory</h2>
 
  <p>For a person with dementia it might be difficult to remember what just happened, but she can easily remember events from the childhood years up until being a young adult. It might be difficult learning and remembering new information. The person can change from being in the past, present and different ages.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  
 <p>Don’t keep asking questions that the person can’t answer. To try to connect, talk about things in the past.
</p>
  <p><strong>Why is the person acting this way:</strong></p>
  
<p>Losing your short-term memory means that you easily get disoriented, don’t know where you are, what time of the day it is, and what’s happening around you. The long-term memory disappears at a late stage of the disease. Old memories can be triggered by people who have been important earlier in life, for example teachers, parents, siblings, or neighbours.</p>
