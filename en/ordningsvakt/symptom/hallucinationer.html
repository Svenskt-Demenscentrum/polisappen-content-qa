  <h2>Hallucinations</h2>
  
  <p>The person sees things and talks to people that don’t exist.</p>
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  <ul>

<li>It’s important that you try to imagine the situation the person is in. You can do that by sharing the experience or confirming the feeling.</li>

<li>You can say: ”I can see that you’re scared, how can I help?”</li>

<li>If the person is aware that she is hallucinating you can say: ”I understand that you are seeing something, but I can’t see it.”</li>

<li>If she sees for example unpleasant animals and thinks they are real, the best thing to do is to listen and confirm. You can say: ”I understand that the animals seem scary to you. Come on, let’s leave.”</li>
</ul>
    
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
  <p>Hallucinations are the pictures in your mind which the damaged brain evokes. This can appear as the disease has progressed a while. Some people get scared and anxious, while others aren’t bothered that much.</p>
