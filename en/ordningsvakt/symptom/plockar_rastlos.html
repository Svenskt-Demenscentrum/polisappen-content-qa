<h2>Restlessness and picking at things</h2>
<p>The person paces up and down. Perhaps pulls a door handle or repeatedly picks at things.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
<p>Unless the person seems to suffer, there is no reason to interrupt this behaviour. If the situation becomes difficult, you can distract the person like this:</p>
<ul>

<li>Talk about the clothes: ”What a nice hat”, ”That jacket seems warm”, etc.</li>

<li>Point at for example a bird, a child that plays, or something else that can stop the behaviour.</li>

<li>If you feel comfortable and it suits the situation, hum a song or play some music on your cell phone.</li>

<li>If possible, offer something to eat or drink in order to gain energi and rest a while.</li>

<li>Some become calm from touching, others don’t.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>

<p>People with dementia might lose the ability to halt and stop this kind of behaviour. It might also be a way to handle anxiety and to get rid of stored-up energy.</p>
