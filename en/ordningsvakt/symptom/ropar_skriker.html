<h2>Shouting and screaming</h2>


<p>The person yells out.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Take the person aside in order to reduce impressions.</li>

<li>Distract by trying to involve the person in an activity, like carrying a bag.</li>

<li>Take the person for a short walk, or do somthing else that gives new impressions.</li>

<li>If possible, distract by playing music in the phone.</li>

<li>Some like the comfort of holding hands.</li>

</ul>


<p><strong>Why is the person acting this way:</strong></p>

<p>This behaviour might be an expression of feeling abandoned, a cry for help, or for a parent. It could also be a mechanical reaction or be caused by pain. The person who has dementia is not always aware of his behaviour.</p>
