<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>It used to be a common notion that only those who are very old get dementia, and that they move to a nursing home pretty soon. It is true that most people who get dementia are old, but also younger ones can get it. And today, most people with dementia keep living at home for many years before they move. That means that you are very likely to run into someone with dementia in your profession as a security guard.</p>

<p>Often, dementia causes changes in behaviour. A person might suddenly without apparent reasons become angry or very worried. However, there is most of the time something that causes these changes in behaviour. It could for example be the inability to express fear or pain in any other way. Dementia makes the person feel lost.</p>

<p>Having some knowledge about dementia gives you a better chance of handling difficult situations and trying different alternatives. Your actions affect the personâ€™s dignity and self-esteem.</p>

<p>When you meet people with dementia you might need to find out who they are and where they are going. You might also have to calm them down and divert their attention or aggression.</p>

<p>This application is meant to be a tool for you to help you interact with a person with dementia in the best possible way.</p>
