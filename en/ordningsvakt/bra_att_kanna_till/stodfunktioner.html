  <h2>Society’s support</h2>
<h3><i>The municipality</i></h3>
  <p><strong>Social services</strong> are in charge of social wellfare issues in the municipality or district. All municipalities have their guidelines for the way they work.</p>
    
<p><strong>A needs assessor</strong> is the municipality official who assesses and handles cases according to the Social Services Act.</p>
    
<p><strong>Home care services</strong> offer help at home. The person with dementia has to be willing to accept the help.</p>
    
<p><strong>Day care units</strong> for people with dementia are mostly open during the day, Monday to Friday.</p>
    
<p><strong>Nursing homes:</strong> Even if a person with dementia is not safe in her home, she can never be forced to move to a nursing home. She must accept and be willing to move. Family members can try to persuade her. Only in exceptional cases may custodial care be enforced.</p>
    
<h2>The county</h2>
<p><strong>The district health care centre</strong> is where the person’s doctor, nurses, physiotherapist and occupational therapist work.</p>
    
<p><strong>Home nursing</strong> can be offered by the district health care centre, if a person needs health care on a regular basis. This means that the person can get care in her home and that doctors and nurses are available day and night.</p>
