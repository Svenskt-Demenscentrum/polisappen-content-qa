<p>Actions that involve force or constraint are not allowed without consent from the person (read more under Constraint).</p>

  <h2>Constraint</h2>
<p>Healthcare staff and social services must always be aware that all actions taken against a person’s will are regarded as force or constraint, unless the person gives his or her consent. The following are such examples:</p>

  <p><strong>Holding someone down</strong></p>
<p>To try to control a certain behaviour by holding someone down against their will.</p>

  <p><strong>Locking the door</strong></p>
<p>Even if the purpose is to protect, staff may not lock a person up without consent.</p> 

  <p><strong>Medication</strong></p>
<p>Medication used as a routine measure to calm a person down could be regarded as an act of force. Before the staff may administer sedatives they must try to find out what could have caused the anxiety or aggression and try to solve the problem.</p>
