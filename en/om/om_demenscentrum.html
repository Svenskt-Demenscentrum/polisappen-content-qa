  <h3>About Swedish Dementia Centre</h3>
  
  <p><strong>The Swedish Dementia Centre (SDC)</strong> was founded in 2008. The commission of creating a national centre for excellence in dementia care was given to two foundations, Silviahemmet and Stockholm Gerontology Research Center, by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and commissioned by the National Board of Health and Welfare. SDC became an independent foundation in 2013.</p>
  
  <p>SDC is financed through governmental support and grant organizations. Our commission is to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>collect, structure and disseminate knowledge about dementia and dementia care</li>
  <li>compile evaluations and research results</li>
  <li>develop more practically orientated knowledge</li>
  <li>facilitate translation of research and implementation of new knowledge into nursing and care, interventions and social policy</li>
  <li>be a link between research, practice and decision makers</li>
  <li>be the hub of a national network for research and development units.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our vision is to be a centre of excellence that gradually builds up a bank of knowledge within the area of dementia, and actively promotes development in care of persons with dementia â€“ towards a more dementia-friendly society.</p>
