  <h2>Driver’s licence</h2>

  <p>The person with dementia keeps driving in spite of cancelled driver’s licence.</p>
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p> 
<p>Doctors are obligated to report patients who for medical reasons are not fit to drive. Dementia is one of several diagnoses that could be such a medical reason. Research has shown that more than half of the drivers who die in traffic accidents and are older that 65, have signs of dementia in the brain.</p>
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
<p>Some people with dementia simply forget that their driver’s licence has been cancelled. Others may feel that their identity is so strongly associated with driving that it’s hard to resist.</p>

  <h2>GPS</h2>
<p>Why isn’t for example a gps alarm used to help finding och identifying someone?</p>

  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
<p>Actions that involve force or constraint are not allowed without consent from the person (read more under Constraint). However, if a person with dementia often gets lost and is in need of an alarm, you can talk to the nursing home staff and see if they can get a consent from the person to the use of a GPS.<br>
It’s important to know that relatives never can give that consent, when it comes to actions from social services and healthcare.</p>

  <h2>Constraint</h2>
<p>Healthcare staff and social services must always be aware that all actions taken against a person’s will are regarded as force or constraint, unless the person gives his or her consent. The following are such examples:</p>

  <p><strong>Holding someone down</strong></p>
<p>To try to control a certain behaviour by holding someone down against their will.</p>

  <p><strong>Locking the door</strong></p>
<p>Even if the purpose is to protect, staff may not lock a person up without consent.</p> 

  <p><strong>Medication</strong></p>
<p>Medication used as a routine measure to calm a person down could be regarded as an act of force. Before the staff may administer sedatives they must try to find out what could have caused the anxiety or aggression and try to solve the problem.</p>

  <h2>Power of attorney</h2>

<p>When people with dementia have reached that phase when they are no longer able to act or make decisions, there are different ways to help them.<br>
A power of attorney can be written which states that for example a close relative may represent the person.<br>
  When meeting relatives it might be good to know about:  
  <p><strong>General power of attorney</strong></p>
<p>A general power of attorney gives a relative the right to on behalf of the person pay bills, sign or annul contracts and deal with health care issues, to name a few examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Lasting power of attorney</strong></p> 
<p>A lasting power of attorney includes the same things as the general power of attorney and can be used further into the progression of the disease. Unlike the general power of attorney, a lasting power of attorney needs to be attested by two people.</p>
