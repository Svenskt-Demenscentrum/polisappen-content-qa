  <h2>Tips on interaction</h2>

  <p>Under the right circumstances, a person with dementia can concentrate for quite a while, in spite of the disease. Some advice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Try to avoid distractions like different noises or other impressions.
-Turn down the radio and other sounds.
-Dim the lights.
-An isolated place without distractions makes it easier for the person to concentrate on what you are saying.</li>
      
    <li>Approach the person from the front.</li>
      
    <li>Avoid physical restraints like holding someone.</li>
      
    <li>Introduce yourself and say that you are there to help.</li>
      
    <li>Let hem know you are a police-officer.</li>
      
    <li>Make it clear that you work for them and not against them.</li>
      
    <li>Beware of your body language.</li>
      
    <li>Never show that you are stressed, since a person with dementia is extra sensitive to stress.</li>
      
    <li>Present information and instructions in a positive way.</li>
      
    <li>Be calm and friendly.</li>
      
    <li>Speak slowly with a low voice. Loudness can be interpreted as something negative.</li>
      
    <li>Respect the person’s personal space and step back.</li>
      
    <li>Don’t give too much information at the same time.</li>
      
    <li>Use short sentences and give simple explanations.</li>
      
    <li>Ask one question at a time and allow the person time to reply. A person with dementia needs to organise his thoughts.</li>
      
    <li>Be hands-on.
– Ask for example ”Do you want to go home?” instead of ”Your family must be worried about you.” 
– Use your body language, like pointing at things, to reinforce what you are saying.</li>
      
    <li>Remember that nobody wants to lose their dignity. Boost their self esteem by saying for example:
– You seem upset. Can you tell me what’s wrong?
– I can tell that you are lost. Can I help you?
– Don’t worry. I’m here to help you.</li>
      
    <li>If he or she can’t reply, try something else:
– Are you cold?
– Do you want a sandwich or coffee?</li>
      
    <li>Different people can react differently in a certain situation. Look out for reactions and signs of anxiety and fear.</li>
      
    <li>Every person is unique. Try to find out what works for the person in front of you.</li>
      
    <li>Regardless of the situation, it’s important to make sure that the person with dementia gets help. Sometimes it’s the health care that needs to get involved and it’s your responsibilty to contact them. Keep the person company until more help arrives.</li>
      
    <li>Avoid locking the person up or isolating her. That could cause desorientation and lead to a panic attack.</li>
      
    <li>Undvik att låsa in personen eller på annat vis isolera henne. Det kan stärka en förvirring och 
      desorientering eller utlösa panik. </li>
  </ul>
