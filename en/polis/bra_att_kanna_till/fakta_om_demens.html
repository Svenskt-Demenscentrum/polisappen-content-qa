  <h2>Facts on dementia</h2>

<p>In Sweden, around 150 000 people have dementia, and each year 25 000 get this diagnosis. Age is the strongest known risk factor. However, 10 000 people in Sweden under 65 have young onset dementia.</p> 
<p>Dementia is a syndrome and a term used for a number of symptoms caused by a disease or damage to the nerve cells in the brain. Dementia makes our cognitive functions deteriorate and can affect our thinking, orientation, memory, comprehension, judgement, language, and behaviour.</p>
<p>Which symptoms you get depends on which area of the brain is damaged. Dementia affects each person individually and everyone doesn’t get all of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Even if mostly older people get dementia, also younger ones can get it. It might be difficult to detect at first, since young people with dementia can look physically strong and give a healthy impression.</p> 

<p><strong>Different types of dementia</strong></p>
<p>Out of almost a hundred different types of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia account for about 90 percent of all dementia cases. Symptoms depend on which area of the brain is damaged. The damage affects the intellect.</p>
    
<p><strong>Alzheimer’s disease</strong> is the most common type of dementia. The damage initially takes place in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. As the deterioration continues, additional parts of the brain are affected and begin to shrink. This can cause memory loss, orientation difficulties, confusion, stress, and communication difficuclties.</p>

<p><strong>Vascular dementia</strong> is the second most common form of dementia. It can be caused by a stroke leading to impaired blood flow to the brain. The symptoms often appear suddenly and distinctly. The person’s condition might be stable for a while and then deteriorate. Depending on which area is damaged, this can affect for example the memory, language and personality. Decreased blood flow to the brain often causes reduced initiative och trouble walking.</p> 

<p><strong>Frontotemporal dementia</strong> is more common among younger people in their 50’s. Nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes are damaged, which can cause the person to have sudden outbursts of rage or show poor judgement. This might lead to excessive consumption of alcohol. The symptoms are different from those of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, as speech and memory problems usually appear at a later stage of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Dementia cannot be cured</strong></p>
<p>There is no cure for dementia yet, but it’s possible to relieve symptoms with medication which could increase quality of life. It’s possible to live for several years with dementia. However, progression of the disease makes the condition gradually worse. How long you live with dementia may vary from person to person, but less than three percent live longer than fourteen years.</p>

  <p><strong>Early signs of dementia</strong></p>
  <p>One early sign is that the person with dementia often repeats herself. She might also find it hard to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remember appointments</li>
    <li>find her way, also in familiar areas </li> 
    <li>find words</li>
    <li>concentration</li>
    <li>planning and carrying out an activity.</li>
  </ul>
