<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>When you meet people with dementia, you might need to find out who they are and where they are going. You might also have to calm them down and divert their attention or aggression.</p>

<p>Often, dementia causes changes in behaviour. A person might suddenly without apparent reasons become angry or very worried. However, there is most of the time something that causes these changes in behaviour. It could for example be the inability to express fear or pain in any other way. Dementia makes the person feel lost.</p>

<p>Having some knowledge about dementia gives you a better chance of handling difficult situations and trying different alternatives. Your actions affect the person’s dignity and self-esteem.</p>
    <p>It’s not possible to say exactly how you should approach a person with dementia. It may vary. Every person is unique. Your actions need to be based on who you meet, how far the disease has progressed and if they are aware of their dementia or not.</p>
