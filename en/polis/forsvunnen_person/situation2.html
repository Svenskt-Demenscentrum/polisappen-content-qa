  <p>The police officer Niklas spots an elderly man who is walking at a fast pace across an open field. The description fits Åke, a man with dementia who has been wanted by the police since this morning. Niklas parks his car, and together with his colleague, Mats, he hurries out to catch up with the man.</p>
    
    <p>Niklas remembers the last time this happened. It was a woman who had gone missing from a nursing home. ”Hello, we are from the police. We have got a report that you are missing”, he had said to the woman as they found her in the woods. ”Don’t come near me”, she had hissed and looked terrified as if the police officers had wanted to do her harm. Another police car had been requested for assistance. Niklas remembers the incident as difficult and unpleasant.</p>
  
  <p>This time Niklas decides to try a new strategy. The two police-officers aproach Åke from the front. When Åke sees them he slows down and looks surprised at them. Niklas says: ”Are you out walking? May we join you?” Åke nods his head a bit. They start walking and the police-men try to direct their walk towards the car. After a while they start chatting. Mats calls Åke’s wife and asks him if he wants to talk to her: ”She seems a bit worried about you.” On the phone, Åke’s wife says that she misses him and that a nice cup of coffee is waiting for him. ”The policemen are kind and will drive you home.” When they reach the car, Niklas opens the front door. ”See how nice and warm it is in here”, he says and helps Åke take his seat.</p>
