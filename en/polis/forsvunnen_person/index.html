  <h2>Do not assume anything while searching</h2>
  
<p>When you are searching for a missing person who has dementia, don’t think how you would act in the same situation. The circumstances in this case are different. For example the person might act as if she doesn’t want to be found. The reason for that could be lost ability to call for attention and ask for help, but also a lack of insight that it would be best to turn around and go back.</p>
  
<p>Also, a person with dementia tends to open doors that are located at the end of a corridor. Even if the door doesn’t lead to the expected place, it’s more likely that they will pass through that door than turn around and go back.</p>
  
<p>Often, a person with dementia is unaware that the people around her are worried and are looking for her. Instead, she might feel that she’s being chased and feels that she has to hide. That’s why you cannot be sure that she will reply when she hears her name being called out.</p>

<p>A person with dementia has a hard time making strategical decisions, like moving towards more populated areas for help. On the other hand, she might have a clear picture of where to go. Often, it’s a wellknown place for her, for example the house she has moved from.</p>
