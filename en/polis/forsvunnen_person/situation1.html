<p>The police officer Anna is giving Birgitta a ride home. Birgitta was wandering around in town, seemingly confused. Anna suspects that she has dementia. In the car Birgitta calms down and lets Anna take the key from her bag. In the elevator Birgitta starts to get anxious again. ”I don’t live here”, Birgitta says when Anna opens the door. ”But the key fits and your name is on the door”, Anna says. Birgitta firmly shakes her head.</p>
    
<p>Anna reflects for a while and then turns on the light in the hallway. She looks around and sees some pictures on a sideboard. She picks one of them up, a wedding photo, and shows it to Birgitta. ”I looked good in that dress, don’t you think? But Rune’s suit was too short. Can you see that?” says Birgitta. Anna smiles and nods. Having looked at a few more pictures, Birgitta starts to feel safe and realises that she is home.</p>
