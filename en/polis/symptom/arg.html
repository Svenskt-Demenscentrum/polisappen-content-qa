  <h2>Angry and upset</h2>

  <p>A person is upset and kicks and waves.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
 
  <ul>
    <li>Try to find out the reason why the person is upset. Maybe physical reasons, like pain?</li>
    <li>Could the anger be caused by the feeling of not being able to handle the situation? Too rapid or sudden movements could scare the person, thus making her angry.</li>
    <li>Be aware of your body language.</li>
    <li>Avoid arguing or making corrections.</li>
    <li>Ask one question at a time. Don’t give too much information at the same time.</li>
    <li>Acknowledge the feeling by saying: ”I can see that you’re upset.”</li>
    <li>Try offering something to drink.</li>
    <li>Try diverting the attention by talking about something else, like children, animals, work, etc.</li>
    <li>Prevent outbursts by removing sources of irritation, like noise.</li>
    <li>Leave the person alone for a while.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way?</strong></p>
  <p>The brain damage can give the person cognitive difficulties and problems with concentration. Sorting out all impressions can make her tired, irritated, and extra sensitive to noise.</p>
  <p>There are of course many other reasons why a person becomes agitated. She might feel bemeaned, be in pain or need to go to the bathroom.</p>
  <p>It’s good to know that sedatives are not given to people with dementia. Medication used as a routine measure to calm a person down is regarded as an act of force. For that reason the staff must first try to find out the cause of the aggression before considering using sedatives. It is also not allowed to control behaviour by holding a person down against his will.</p>
