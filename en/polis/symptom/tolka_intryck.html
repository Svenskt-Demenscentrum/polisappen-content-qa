<h2>Interpreting impressions</h2>
  
  <p>For the person with dementia, it’s hard to recognise objects, faces, surroundings, understanding maps, or localising from where a voice comes. She might feel scared about walking across a dark carpet, or become anxious in a busy environment.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  
  <p>You can help the person by trying to minimize impressions and create a calm atmosphere. Some calm down by a touch. Try to imagine how the person with dementia might experience the situation. Being calm, friendly and respectful in a peaceful place, can get you a long way. 
</p>
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
  <p>It’s no longer possible to coordinate impressions in a way that works. It’s hard to interpret and process what they see. It makes it hard to process impressions via the five senses. The brain gets overstrained. It’s common to mix things up.</p>

<p>Sounds appear stronger and depth perception can deteriorate. Sudden, sharp sounds can be intimidating and take focus from the conversation. Carpets and other dark areas of the floor can appear to be large holes, which are difficult to pass.</p>

<p>All impressions can make the person confused and a sense of it being ”too much”. It can make the person angry och anxious. He might lose control over his feelings and get paralysed by fear. He could feel anguish and even get a panic attack.</p>
