<h2>Pacing at night</h2>
  
  <p>Someone is aimlessly out walking at night.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Try to find out why she’s out. Also find out if she’s cold, bothered by noise or in pain.</p>

<p>If the pacing is caused by anxiety, an urge to walk to the childhood home, try to distract by calmly talking about something that can avert attention.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
  
  <p>She might have a hard time sleeping. Dementia often makes it hard to see the difference between day and night. The person might be living in the past and therefore dresses to go home to her mother and father after work.
