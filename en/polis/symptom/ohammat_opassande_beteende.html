  <h2>Unrestrained and inappropriate behaviour</h2>
  
  <p>A person with dementia might confuse his or her spouse with another person, or undress in public. He might also say inappropriate things and insult other people.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  <ul>

<li>Everyone needs to be treated with respect.</li>

<li>Try different approaches.</li>

<li>Don’t be defensive if the person says something mean or inappropriate. Try to let it go and use distractions.</li>

<li>Instead of correcting the person, try to help him by saying: ”Come on, I’ll help you.”</li>

</ul>
  
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
<p>When the frontal parts of the brain get damaged the person often changes his behaviour and becomes unrestrained. It can for example make him swear and say and do inappropriate things. That can be hard for the family to cope with.</p>
