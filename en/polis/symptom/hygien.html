  <h2>Hygiene and dressing</h2>
 
  <p>The person with dementia is having trouble with her personal hygiene and what clothes to wear.</p>
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
 <p>Pay extra attention if you meet someone who for example is wearing a winter coat in the summer, sandals in the winter or a t-shirt on top of the shirt. That could be signs of dementia.</p>
  <p><strong>Why is the person acting this way:</strong></p>
<p>One of the early signs of dementia is that the person might have trouble with her personal hygiene and picking the appropriate clothes to wear. If the person you meet has clothes that are wrinkled, it could mean that she sleeps in them. Itâ€™s possible that she has poor insight about her disease.</p>
