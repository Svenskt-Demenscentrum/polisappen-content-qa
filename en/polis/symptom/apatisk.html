  <h2>Apathetic</h2>
  
  <p>Someone sits quietly and doesnâ€™t seem to notice what goes on around her.</p>
  <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
  <p>To break the apathy, try the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encourage the person to participate.</li>
    <li>Commend and acknowledge.</li>
    <li>Use some humour, maybe try a joke.</li>
    <li>If the person seems to like being close, touch her hand to make contact.</li>
    <li>Ask one question at a time. Wait for the reply before you say something again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
  <p>This behaviour could be a side effect from medication or a depression. It could also be caused by pain or some other physical condition.</p>
