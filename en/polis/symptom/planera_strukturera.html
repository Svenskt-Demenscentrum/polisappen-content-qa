<h2>Planning and structurizing</h2>

<p>The person cannot take in more than one instruction.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
<p>Think about the following:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Think about your body language.</li>
<li>Never show that you are stressed.</li>
<li>Give information and instructions in a positive way. </li>
<li>Speak slowly in a confident and calm way.</li>
<li>Speak in a low voice.</li>
<li>Make several pauses.</li>
<li>Use short sentences and give simple explanations.</li>
<li>Don’t ask the person to make a choice between different options.</li>
<li>Ask one question at a time and allow for time to reply. She might need time to sort out her thoughts.</li>
<li>Be hands-on:
  <ul>
    <li>Ask for example: ”Do you want to go home?” instead of saying: ”Your family is worried about you.”</li>
   <li>Use you body language to emphasise what you are saying. You can for example point to show a car or a phone.</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>

<p>For a person with dementia it becomes increasingly difficult to think, plan, and carry out activities. It also gets increasingly difficult to understand and do more than one thing in an activity.</p>
