  <h2>Memory problems – repeating questions</h2>
 
  <p>The person repeats questions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  
 <p>Even if it’s tiresome, try to answer the question like it was the first time you heard it. Every time, answer in a way that makes the person feel calm.</p>
    
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
<p>When someone repeats the question several times it could be caused by damage of those parts of the brain that store new information. Therefore the person doesn’t remember that she just asked the question.</p>
