  <h2>Delusions</h2>
  
  <p>The person is upset that someone steals or hides things, that the partner is unfaithful, or believes that someone is trying to poison her.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start by confirming what the person says and by doing that calm him down. Show that you take the problem seriously: ”What has disappeared? I will check it out.” Or: ”I have written this down and will look into it.”</li>
    <li>You can also help the person look for whatever is missing.</li>
    <li>After that you can distract him by starting to talk about something else.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why is the person acting this way:</strong></p>
  <p>Delusions are something rather difficult that may appear at a later stage of the disease. Most of the time it’s not possible to persuade the person by using logical and rational explanations.</p>
