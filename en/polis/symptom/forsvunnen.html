 <h2>Missing person</h2>
  
  <p>A person is missing.</p>
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong><br>
  The sooner the person is found, the better. A photo of the missing person, and information on where she used to live and work earlier in life, might be useful.</p> 

<p>Talk to family members and nursing home staff in order to get some information on the person’s background. Ask for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What’s the person’s memory like?</li>
    <li>Does he have any ties to a certain area or activity?</li>
    <li>What nationality is he? If the person can speak, which language?</li>
    <li>Is the person able to have a conversation?</li>
    <li>What activities has he been involved in?</li>
    <li>Any other background information that could offer clues on where to search?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don’t take anything for granted when you search.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Don’t start by thinking what you would have done. A person with dementia might not be thinking logically. Anything is possible.</li>
   <li>A locked door might have been locked automatically when the person left.</li>
   <li>He could have gone into a wardrobe because:
 <ul>
  <li>He doesn’t have the ability to think ”I shouldn’t go in here since it’s a wardrobe”.</li>
  <li>Doors are meant to be opened.</li>
  <li>His focus is on keep moving.</li>
  <li>Entering someone else’s room in the nursing home or at the hospital could cause desorientation. It could even make the person go into someone else’s bed.</li></ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
  <p>Pacing is a medical condition where the person with dementia has lost the ability to find his way. He might not be able to stop walking around even though he’s exhausted, thirsty, scared, warm, cold, hurt or in pain.
      
  The constant pacing can be connected to the duty of ”going to work” or the need to ”go home”.</p>
  
  <p>Other possible reasons for pacing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>anxiety</li>
    <li>a need for change</li>
    <li>memory loss or impaired memory</li>
    <li>excessive energy</li>
    <li>living in the past</li>
    <li>boredom</li>
    <li>confusing day and night</li>
    <li>continues an old habit, e.g. go out walking a certain time</li>
    <li>agitation/aggression</li>
    <li>uncomfortable or in pain</li>
    <li>believing they need to go to work.</li>
  </ul>
