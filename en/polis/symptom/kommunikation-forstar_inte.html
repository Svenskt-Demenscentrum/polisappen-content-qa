  <h2>Communication – the person doesn’t understand</h2>
  
  <p>The person with dementia is frustrated by not understanding what people around her say, and not being able to express herself.</p>
  <p><strong>What can I do:</strong></p>
  <ul>
Try to prevent the person from feeling stupid. When you talk, keep this in mind:
<li>Adapt the conversation.</li>
<li>Sit down, make eye contact, talk slowly.</li>
<li>Use a soft body language.</li>
<li>Wait for a reply before you keep talking.</li>
<li>Let the conversation take time.</li>   
<li>Instead of asking questions, try to give clues that could lead to an answer.</li>   
<li>Rather ask if the person is hungry than what he has eaten.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Why does the person act this way:</strong></p>
<p>The self esteem gets affected for someone who doesn’t understand a question. It gets hard to express something important. Often this frustration results in agitation.</p>
